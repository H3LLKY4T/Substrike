# Substrike
Substrike is a Flask-based web application that helps identify subdomains vulnerable to takeover by analyzing their CNAME records and DNS status. It efficiently checks for misconfigured cloud services and abandoned subdomains, making it a valuable tool for penetration testers and bug bounty hunters.
